#' Thickness measurements of pharmaceutical tablets
#'
#' @description
#' This dataset contains physical measurements of pharmaceutical tablets (pills) 
#' including measurement room conditions. The data and the insights it provides 
#' are typical of an industrial context with high production throughput and 
#' stringent dimensional requirements.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 675 observations on 11 variables:
#' \describe{
#' \item{Position}{Position of the part on the device (Position 1, Position 2, ...)}
#' \item{Size}{Size class (L, M, S)}
#' \item{Tablet}{Part number (L001, L002, ...)}
#' \item{Replicate, Day}{Measurement replicate and Day, a sequential numbers}
#' \item{Date}{Measurement date (POSIXct) }
#' \item{Operator}{Operator name (ficticious)}
#' \item{Thickness}{Tablet thickness [micrometers]}
#' \item{Temperature, Relative Humidity, Luminescence}{Room conditions of temperature [Â°C], humidity [percentage] and lighting [Lux]}
#' }
#' 
#' @details
#' Variable names are deliberately long and not clean and categorical variables 
#' not coded as factors in order to provide material for name cleansing and type 
#' conversions which are part of the industRial Data Science book examples and exercises.
#' 
#' @source Based on a gage r&R (gage reproducibility and repeatability) 
#' study performed in 2020 on a physical measurement of parts coming out of a 
#' high throughput industrial equipment.
