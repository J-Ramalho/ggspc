#' Cycles to failure of ebikes frames after temperature treatment.
#' 
#' @format A tibble with 4 observations on 6 variables.
#' 
#' @description A data set with the results of aging tests on several groups
#' of ebikes frames (g1, g2, ...). Each entry corresponds to 
#' the number of cycles to failure for each level of treatment temperature-

#' \describe{
#'   \item{temperature}{Position of the part on the device}
#'   \item{g1}{group 1, remaining groups have names g2 to g5}
