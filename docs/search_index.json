These examples are grouped in Case Studies in a “cookbook” approach, making it easier to directly adopt the tools. They come from varied manufacturing industries, mostly where repetitive production in massive quantities is involved, such as: pharmaceuticals food electronics watch making automotive Product Development and Manufacturing are very important activities in society because bringing innovative products to the market has an immense potential to improve the quality of life of everyone. Additionally Data Science brings new powerful approaches to the engineering and manufacturing of consumer goods, helping minimising environmental impact, improving quality and keeping costs under control. How to use this book We assume the reader is familiar with product development and manufacturing quality methodologies such as dmaic and six sigma and the associated statistical concepts. Furthermore it is considered that he brings at least a beginner knowledge on R. The book focus is on putting these areas together. Being a collection of case studies, the book is better used as a reference book. The navigation bar on the left is organized by domain and a full list of the Case Studies, Datasets and R functions is available in the section Table of contents. Complementing the text, a series of tutorials can be accessed either on line or locally to practice dynamically key statistical concepts. For the online option no specific software installation is required. A list of web links and detailed instructions on local installation can be seen in the section Tutorials. To go even further all the case studies data sets, selected example functions and the textbook original files can be downloaded as a package called {industRial}. For guidelines on how to use them refer to the section Datasets and more. Finally we refer to several good quality books on both Data Science and Product Development that have served to provide the required theoretical background. These cover key disciplines such as six sigma, statistics and computer programming. This book aims complementing them and showcase how to benefit from recent software in this area. A full list can be found in References. Content overview The case studies are organized according the a logical product development flow. The text starts with case studies in the domain of Design for Six Sigma. These are some practical tools in that help prioritizing problems and get focus on how to tackle them. The next group of case studies covers the domain of Measurement System Analysis, an initial important step when developing a product or manufacturing process. Here is discussed how to analyze the response of a measurement device in terms of its bias and its uncertainty. The next large group of case studies is the Design of Experiments. This corresponds to the core of the R&amp;D activities and provides approaches to minimize the quantity of trials and time to reach to a sufficient knowledge of how the product or system works. Also on how to obtain the right balance on its features and properties to obtain the desired output. A final group of case studies presents ways to get the manufacturing process in control according to what was defined in the product development phase. These are the well known Statistical Process Control and Capability studies.

Many tools exist to do Data Analysis and Statistics with different degrees of power and difficulty such as: Spreadsheets: Excel, Libreoffice, Numbers Proprietary software: Minitab, Mathlab Programming languages: Visual Basic, R, Python, Julia Databases: sqlite, postgre, mysql, mongodb Choosing the right set of tools for Data Science is often not a very scientific task. Mostly is a matter of what is available and what our colleagues, customers or suppliers use. As with everything it is important to remain open to evaluate new tools and approaches and even to be able to combine them. In this book we’ve chosen to provide all examples in R which is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics https://www.r-project.org/ Besides taste and personnal preference R brings a significant number of specific advantages in the field of Industrial Data Science: R allows for reproducible research This because the algorithms and functions defined to make the calculations can be inspected and all results can be fully reproduced and audited. This is known as reproducible research and is a critical aspect in all areas where a proof is needed such as in equipment validation and product quality reporting. R functions, tools and programs can be adapted and improved Being an open source language, all R libraries and packages added to the basic environment can be not only audited but adapted and improved This is very important as when we enter into details every industry has a slight different way of doing things, different naming conventions, different coeficients and so on. R is extensible R is compatible with most other software on the market and is an excellent “glue” tool allowing for example for data loading from excel files, producing reports in pdf and even building complete dashboards in the form of web pages. Packages All tools applied throughout this book are available in the form of packages of the programming language R. As with all open source code, they’re all available for download with freedom to modification and at no cost. The amount of packages available is extremely large and growing very fast. When selecting new packages it is recommended to check the latest package update. Packages that have had no improvements since more than a couple of years should be questionned. The field evolves rapidly and compatibility and other issues can become painfull. A way to obtain statistics on package history is on metacran or RStudio package manager. Below a comprehensive list of the different packages used in the book: installed_packages &lt;- bind_rows( installed.packages(lib.loc = .Library) %&gt;% as_tibble(), installed.packages(lib.loc = .libPaths()[1]) %&gt;% as_tibble() ) recommended_packages &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/rpackages.xlsx&quot;) %&gt;% filter(Used == &quot;y&quot;) %&gt;% left_join(installed_packages) %&gt;% select(Package, Area, Version) %&gt;% arrange(Area) recommended_packages %&gt;% kable() Package Area Version rcartocolor colors NA viridis colors 0.6.1 datasets data 4.0.5 readr data loading 1.4.0 readxl data loading 1.3.1 dplyr data science 1.0.6 forcats data science 0.5.1 hms data science 1.0.0 janitor data science 2.1.0 lubridate data science 1.7.10 magrittr data science 2.0.1 tibble data science 3.1.1 tidyr data science 1.1.3 broom datascience 0.7.6 tidyverse datascience 1.3.1 purrr functional programming 0.3.4 qicharts2 industrial stats 0.7.1 qcc industrial stats 2.7 SixSigma industrial stats 0.9-52 DoE.base industrial stats 1.1-6 patchwork plotting 1.1.1 ggplot2 plotting 3.3.3 scales plotting 1.1.1 bookdown publishing 0.22 knitr publishing 1.33 stats statistics 4.0.5 tidymodels statistics NA agricolae statistics 1.3-3 car statistics 3.0-10 RcmdrMisc statistics 2.7-1 lsr statistics NA fs sysadmin 1.5.0 glue text 1.4.2 stringr text 1.4.0 Theses packages below are loaded implicitly and not visible in the book text. Be sure to load at minimum the packages below before trying any example: ds_pkgs &lt;- c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;scales&quot;, &quot;janitor&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;stats&quot;, &quot;industRial&quot;, &quot;viridis&quot;, &quot;broom&quot;, &quot;patchwork&quot;) purrr::map(ds_pkgs, library, character.only = TRUE) A common issue in R when compared to python for instance is function masking. As we tend to load all the sets of functions from each package we end up with conflicting function names. In the scope of this text it is mostly the function filter() from {dplyr} which conflicts with the function with the same name from {stats}. We use the most simple technique which is to add filter &lt;- dplyr::filter in the beginning of our script to precise which function we want to give priority and we pre-append the package name to all calls of the other function such as stats::filter. For more sophisticated ways to handle this issue we suggest the package {import}. We’re highlighting now some specific packages from this list that are used in the book and that bring powerful features in analysis of data from R&amp;D and Operations. Wherever they are required in the book they are loaded explicitly so that we know where the functions come from. six sigma SixSigma is a very complete and robust package by Emilio L.Cano (Emilio L. Cano • Javier M. Moguerza 2015). It provides well many well tested functions in the area of quality management. qcc qcc is another extremely complete and solid package. It was developped and is maintained by Luca Scrucca and offers a very large range of statistical process control charts and capability analysis. Short examples in its vignette: qcc vignette qicharts2 I recommend qichart2 specifically for the nice pareto plots. As many niche packages we need to be awere that the number of contributers is small meaning that it cannot be as thouroughly tested as community packages. DoE.base This package is one of the most complete and vast packages in Design of Experiements. It is a first of a large suite of packages on the topic, it has vast functionality and is extremely well documented. DoE.base car The Companion for Applied Regression is also used extensively as it contains many usefull functions to assess the performance of linear models and anova. Datasets and more Datasets An original package with the name {industRial} has been developed as a companion package for this book. It can be downloaded from github with the following command: devtools::install_github(&quot;J-Ramalho/industRial&quot;) The primary package goal is to make easily available all the data sets from all case studies. All dataset presented throughout the book are published either fully anonymized. Once the package is correctly installed it can be loaded in the R session as usual with the library() function: library(industRial) Once loaded the data sets become immediately available in memory and can directly be used in the examples presented or for further exploration. Lets confirm this invoking the first data set: dial_control %&gt;% head() %&gt;% kable() Operator Date Defect Location Jane 2018.01.31 Indent 3h Jane 2018.02.02 Indent 3h Jane 2018.02.02 Indent 4h Peter 2018.02.02 Indent 10h Jane 2018.02.03 Scratch 3h Jane 2018.02.03 Indent 3h The dateset can be used and manipulated like any other dataset created in the session or loaded otherwise. For example it can be filtered and assigned to a new variable name: dial_peter &lt;- dial_control %&gt;% filter(Operator == &quot;Peter&quot;) dial_peter %&gt;% head(2) %&gt;% kable() Operator Date Defect Location Peter 2018.02.02 Indent 10h Peter 2018.02.03 Scratch 4h Functions Besides the data sets the {industRial} package also contains toy functions to clean data and plot Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts. The objective here is to showcase how to build such functions and their scope of application is limited to the book case studies. For complete and robust SPC functions we recommend using the {QCC} package also described below. Additionally the package contains theme functions to print and customize the aesthetics of spc charts and other charts. These themes are built on top of the {ggplot2} by H.Wickham and {cowplot} package by Claus O.Wilke. The main objective is to give the reader a starting point for customization of charts in this domain. The complete list of datasets, themes and functions can be seen by listing all objects from the package with ls(): ls(&quot;package:industRial&quot;) [1] &quot;%&gt;%&quot; &quot;battery_charging&quot; &quot;chart_Cpk&quot; [4] &quot;chart_I&quot; &quot;chart_IMR&quot; &quot;dial_control&quot; [7] &quot;ebike_hardening&quot; &quot;ebike_hardening2&quot; &quot;juice_drymatter&quot; [10] &quot;off_spec&quot; &quot;perfume_experiment&quot; &quot;pet_delivery&quot; [13] &quot;pet_doe&quot; &quot;process_Cpk&quot; &quot;process_stats&quot; [16] &quot;process_stats_table&quot; &quot;solarcell_fill&quot; &quot;solarcell_output&quot; [19] &quot;syringe_diameter&quot; &quot;tablet_thickness&quot; &quot;tablet_weight&quot; [22] &quot;theme_industRial&quot; &quot;theme_qcc&quot; or conveniently on the console with industRial:: and then tab. For each function a help page is available and can be obtained the same way as any other R data sets, themes and functions with ?&lt;object&gt; (e.g. ?chart_xbar) Code To go even deeper the text book original Rmd files are also bundled in the package and can be seen in the book folder. A way to get the exact path is with: paste0(.libPaths()[1], &quot;/industRial/book&quot;) [1] &quot;/home/joao/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/industRial/book&quot; Imprint Many packages are available for editing documentation, from notes to blogs up to complete websites. In this book we’ve opted to use the R package {Bookdown} from Yihui Xie further customized with a layout developed by Matthew J. C. Crump. An important aspect to ensure reproducibility of the examples along the time and between users is to have the same programming setup. We’re showing below our setup at the time of rendering the book. devtools::session_info()[[1]] setting value version R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31) os Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS system x86_64, linux-gnu ui X11 language (EN) collate en_US.UTF-8 ctype en_US.UTF-8 tz Europe/Zurich date 2021-05-16 Disclaimer This book presents a variety of software tools and recommended approaches for industrial data analysis.
