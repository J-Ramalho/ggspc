To go further in the exploration of key concepts of this book a set of dynamic exercises and quizzes is available on the web and can be freely accessed with the links below.

[Pareto charts](https://thoth.shinyapps.io/pareto/)  
Building on the *The dial polishing workshop* case study from the Design for Six Sigma chapter, train building pareto charts using the `{qichart2}` package and explore how playing with different variables gives new insights into apparently simple data collections.

[Anova](https://thoth.shinyapps.io/anova/)  
Develop a sensitivity to how the p value is calculated by playing with a dynamic anova chart. This exercise is based on the *The e-bike frame hardening process* of the DOE Interactions chapter.
