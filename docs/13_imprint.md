# Imprint

Many packages are available for editing documentation, from notes to blogs up to complete websites. In this book we've opted to use the R package `{Bookdown}` from Yihui Xie further customized with a layout developed by [Matthew J. C. Crump](https://community.rstudio.com/t/bookdown-contest-submission-gitbook-style-tufte-style-for-web-book/11666). 

An important aspect to ensure reproducibility of the examples along the time and between users is to have the same programming setup. We're showing below our setup at the time of rendering the book. 


```r
devtools::session_info()[[1]]
