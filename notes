Notes and ideas for the book

what makes this book different from what is on the market:

- no stats or quality theory only case studies
- all tools have suggested application cases
- no R theory, only application examples
- step by step implementation of minimal examples
- no tentative to make coherent de overall product development or quality approach
- accompaigns the ggspc and other packages developped by myself
- examples fully based on tidyverse and broom
- no reusage of tools from sixsigma, qcc and similar packages
