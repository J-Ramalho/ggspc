A way to go beyond the statistical description of samples and direct comparison between different tests it is to establish a model. Models help us simplify the reality and draw general conclusions. The case studies in this unit introduce linear models and their applications. They also serve as the backbone for statistical inference and forecasting. These are two important techniques because they provide mathematical evidence of such general conclusions in a context where the test quantities are strongly limited as for example in lifecycle testing of expensive mechanical parts.

Mountain bikes frames are submitted to many different efforts, namely bending, compression and vibration. Obviously no one expects a bike frame to break in regular usage and it is hard to commercialy claim resistance to failure as a big thing. Nevertheless on the long term a manufacturer reputation is made on performance features such as the number of cycles of effort that the frame resists. An e-bike manufacturing company is looking to increase the duration of its frames by improving the  <b class="highlight">e-bike frame hardening</b> process.

A test has been run with five groups of 10 bike frames submitted to four different treatment temperature levels and the data collected in the R tibble `ebike_hardening` presented below:

```{r tbl-ebikeraw}
head(ebike_hardening) %>%
  kable(align = "c")
```

This type of two way entry is friendly for data collection but for manipulation with the `{tidyverse}` package functions it is often easier to transform it in a long format.

```{r}
ebike_narrow <- ebike_hardening %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("g"),
    names_to = "observation",
    values_to = "cycles"
  ) %>%
  group_by(temperature) %>%
  mutate(cycles_mean = mean(cycles)) %>%
  ungroup()

slice_head(.data = ebike_narrow, n = 5) %>% 
  kable(align = "c", 
        caption = "e-bike hardening experiment data")
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = ebike_narrow) +
  geom_point(aes(x = temperature, y = cycles)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = temperature, y = cycles_mean), color = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 10, labels = label_number(big.mark = "'")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "e-bike frame hardening process",
       subtitle = "Raw data plot",
       x = "Furnace Temperature [°C]",
       y = "Cycles to failure [n]")
```

### Linear model {#lm}

We start by establishing the model, ensuring for now that we leave the variable `temperature` as a numeric vector. 

```{r}
ebike_lm <- lm(cycles ~ temperature, data = ebike_narrow)
summary(ebike_lm)
```

With the summary function we can many different outputs such as the coefficients and the R-squared which we will look into more detail now. As usual, we first inspect the data with a first plot. In this case we're adding a smoothing geometry with the lm method:

```{r}
ggplot(ebike_narrow) +
  geom_point(aes(x = temperature, y = cycles)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = temperature, y = cycles), method = "lm") +
  geom_point(aes(x = temperature, y = cycles_mean), color = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 10, labels = label_number(big.mark = "'")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "e-bike frame hardening process",
       subtitle = "Raw data plot",
       x = "Furnace Temperature [°C]",
       y = "Cycles to failure [n]")
```

### Contrasts treatment {#contr.treatment}

In our case the experiementer has selected to control the levels of the temperature variable in what is called a fixed effects model, accepting that conclusions in the comparisons of the levels cannot be extended to levels that were not tested. For this we're now going to convert the variable to a factor and establish again the model and note that it will give the same R squared but naturally different coefficients. 

```{r}
ebike_factor <- ebike_narrow %>%
  mutate(temperature = as_factor(temperature))
ebike_lm_factor <- lm(
  cycles ~ temperature, 
  data = ebike_factor,
  contrasts = list(temperature = "contr.treatment")
  )
summary(ebike_lm_factor)
```

In order to be precise, we're making explicit in the lm function that the contrasts argument is "contr.treatment", although this is the default in R. More on contrasts on the Case Study on $2^k$ designs. The current contrasts settings can be seen as follows:

```{r}
getOption("contrasts")
```

### Predict {#predict}

Following the residuals analysis and the anova our model is validated. 

A model is usefull for predictions. In a random effects model where conclusions can applied to the all the population we can predict values at any value of the input variables. In that case reusing the model with temperature as a numeric vector we could have a prediction for various temperature values such as:

```{r}
ebike_new <- tibble(temperature = c(170, 160, 200, 210))
predict(ebike_lm, newdata = ebike_new)
```

We can see that the prediction at the tested levels is slightly different from the measured averages at those levels. This is because the linear interpolation line is not passing exactly by the averages.

Anyway this is a fixed effects model and we can only take conclusions at the levels at which the input was tested. We can check that the predictions correspond to the averages we've calculated for each level:

```{r}
ebike_new <- data.frame(temperature = as_factor(c("160", "200")))
predict(ebike_lm_factor, newdata = ebike_new)
```


We're now ready to assess the validity of the model in order to be ready for our main task which is the comparison of the means using an anova.

In order to assess the model performance we're going to look into the residuals. R provides direct ploting functions with the base and stats packages but in this first example we're going to break down the analysis and further customise the plots. We are also going to make usage of some additional statistical tests to confirm our observations from the plots. In subsequent chapters we'll have a more selective approach, where plots and tests are made on a needed basis.

We start by loading the package broom which will help us retrieving the data from the lm object into a data frame.

Now we build and show below an extract of the "augmented" dataframe

### Model augment {#augment}

```{r}
library(broom)
```

```{r}
ebike_aug <- augment(ebike_lm_factor) %>%
  mutate(index = row_number())
ebike_aug %>%
  head() %>%
  kable(align = "c")
```

We can see we've obtained detailed model parameters such us fitted values and residuals for each DOE run.

### Timeseries plot {#residuals_timeseries}

For this plot we need to ensure that the order of plotting in the x axis corresponds exactly to the original data collection order. This plot allows us to assess for strange patterns such as a  tendency to have runs of positive of negative results which indicates that the independency assumption does not hold. If patterns emerge then there may be correlation in the residuals.

```{r}
ebike_aug %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = index, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 10, labels = label_number(big.mark = "'")) +
  labs(
    title = "e-bike frame hardening process",
    subtitle = "Linear model - Residuals timeseries",
    y = "Index",
    x = "Fitted values"
  )
```

Nothing pattern emerges from the current plot and the design presents itself ^well randomised.

### Autocorrelation test {#autocorrelation}

It is always good to keep in mind that all visual observations can be complemented with a statistical test. In this case we're going to use the durbinWatson test from the car package (Companion to Applied Regression).

```{r}
library(car)
```

```{r}
durbinWatsonTest(ebike_lm_factor)
```

Although the output shows Autocorrelation of -0.53 we have to consider that the p value is greater than 0.05 thus there is not enough significance to say that there is autocorrelation. 

### Residuals-Fit plot {#residuals_fit}

If the model is correct and the assumptions hold, the residuals should be structureless. In particular they should be unrelated to any other variable including the predicted response.

```{r}
ebike_aug %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 10, labels = label_number(big.mark = "'")) +
  labs(
    title = "e-bike frame hardening process",
    subtitle = "Linear model - Residuals vs Fitted values",
    y = "Residuals",
    x = "Fitted values"
  )
```

In this plot we see no variance anomalies such as a higher variance for a certain factor level or other types of skweness.

### Homocedasticity {#homocedasticity}

Equality of variances

In the e-bike hardening process, the normality assumption is not in question, so we can apply Bartlett’s test to the etch rate data.


```{r}
bartlett.test(cycles ~ temperature, data = ebike_factor)
```

The P-value is P = 0.934, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis. There is no evidence to counter the claim that all five variances are the same. This is the same conclusion reached by analyzing the plot of residuals versus fitted values.

Notes: 
* the var.test function cannot be used here as it applies to the two levels case only
* this test is sensitive to the normality assumption, consequently, when the validity of this assumption is doubtful, the Bartlett test should not be used and replace by the modified Levene test for example

### Normality plot

As the sample size is relatively small we're going to use a qq plot instead of an histogram to assess the normality of the residuals.

```{r}
ebike_aug %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = .resid)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 10, labels = label_number(big.mark = "'")) +
  labs(
    title = "e-bike frame hardening process",
    subtitle = "Linear model - qq plot",
    y = "Residuals",
    x = "Fitted values"
  )
```

The plot suggests normal distribution. We see that the error distribution is aproximately normal. In the fixed effects model we give more importance to the center of the values and here we consider acceptable that the extremes of the data tend to bend away from the straight line.
The verification can be completed by a test. For populations < 50 use the shapiro-wilk normality test.

### Normality test {#shapiroTest}

```{r}
shapiro.test(ebike_aug$.resid)
```

p > 0.05 indicates that the residuals do not differ significantly from a normally distributed population.

### Standard Residuals-Fit plot {#std_residuals_fit}

This specific Standardized residuals graph also help detecting outliers in the residuals (any residual > 3 standard deviations is a potential outlier).

```{r}
ebike_aug %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .std.resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "e-bike frame hardening process",
       subtitle = "Linear model - Standardised Residuals vs Fitted values",
       y = "Standardised Residuals",
       x = "Fitted values")
```

The plot shows no outliers to consider in this DOE.

### Outliers test {#outliers}

In a case where we were doubtfull we could go further and make a statistical test to assess if a certain value was an outlier. A usefull test is available in the car package.

```{r}
outlierTest(ebike_lm_factor)
```

In this case, the Bonferroni adjusted p value comes as NA confirming that there is no outlier in the data.   

### Cooks distance {#cooks}

```{r}
ebike_aug %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = .cooksd, y = .std.resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "e-bike frame hardening process",
       subtitle = "Residuals vs Leverage",
       y = "Standardised Residuals",
       x = "Cooks distance")
```

### Coefficient of determination {#R-squared}

The R square can be extracted from the linear model that has been used to build the Anova model.

```{r}
summary(ebike_lm_factor)$r.squared
```

Thus, in the e-bike hardening process, the factor “temperature” explains about 88% percent of the variability in etch rate.

Anova fixed effects assumes that:
- errors are normally distributed and are independent

As the number of residuals is too small we're not checking the normality via the histogram but rather with a a Q-Q plot.
