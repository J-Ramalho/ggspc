This book provides examples on how to use Data Science tools and techniques in Product Development and Manufacturing. These examples are grouped in Case Studies in a "cookbook" approach, making it easier to directly adopt the tools. They come from varied manufacturing industries, mostly where repetitive production in massive quantities is involved, such as:

+ pharmaceuticals
+ food
+ electronics
+ watch making
+ automotive

Product Development and Manufacturing are very important activities in society because bringing innovative products to the market has an immense potential to improve the quality of life of everyone. 

Additionally Data Science brings new powerful approaches to the engineering and manufacturing of consumer goods, helping minimising environmental impact, improving quality and keeping costs under control.

**How to use this book**

We assume the reader is familiar with product development and manufacturing quality methodologies such as dmaic and six sigma and the associated statistical concepts. Furthermore it is considered that he brings at least a beginner knowledge on R. The book focus is on putting these areas together.

Being a collection of case studies, the book is better used as a reference book. To get to the desired section either use the later navigation bar or refer to the detailed table of contents which includes a full list of Case Studies, Datasets and R functions. 

For a first reading, the book can be taken from beginning to the end as the Case Studies are organized according the a logical product development flow. The book starts with Case Studies in the domain of Design for Six Sigma. These are some practical tools in that help prioritizing problems and get focus on how to tackle them. The next group of Case Studies is in the domain of Measurement System Analysis, an initial important step when developing a product or manufacturing process. Here is discussed how to analyse the response of a measurement device in terms of its bias and its uncertainty. The next big group of Case Studies is the Design of Experiments. This corresponds to the core of the R&D activities and provides approaches to minimize the quantity of trials and time to reach to a sufficient knowledge of how the product or system works and how to obtain the right balance on its features and properties to obtain the desired output. A final group of Case Studies presents ways to get the manufacturing process in control according to what was defined in the product development phase. These are the well known Statistical Process Control and Capability studies.

Additionally we refer to several good quality books on both Data Science and Product Development that have served to provide the required theoretical  background. These cover key disciplines such as six sigma, statistics and computer programming. This book aims complementing them and showcase how to benefit from recent software in this area.
