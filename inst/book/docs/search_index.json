These examples are grouped in Case Studies in a “cookbook” approach, making it easier to directly adopt the tools. They come from varied manufacturing industries, mostly where repetitive production in massive quantities is involved, such as: pharmaceuticals food electronics watch making automotive Product Development and Manufacturing are very important activities in society because bringing innovative products to the market has an immense potential to improve the quality of life of everyone. Additionally Data Science brings new powerful approaches to the engineering and manufacturing of consumer goods, helping minimising environmental impact, improving quality and keeping costs under control. How to use this book In this book it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the product development and manufacturing quality methodologies such as dmaic and six sigma and the associated statistical concepts. Furthermore it is considered that he brings at least a beginner knowledge on R. The book focus is then on putting the different areas together. Being a collection of case studies, the book is better used as a reference book. To get to the desired section go to the contents session which includes a full list of Case Studies, Datasets and R functions. Additionally we refer to several good quality books on both Data Science and Product Development that have served to provide the required theoretical background. These cover key disciplines such as six sigma, statistics and computer programming. This book aims complementing them and showcase how to benefit from recent software in this area. Acknowledgements I would like to express my gratitude to the instructors and colleagues who have spent time sharing their knowledge, answering my questions and giving me inputs: Enrico Chavez, Iegor Rudnytskyi, Giulia Ruggeri, Harry Handerson and Bobby Stuijfzand from the EPFL ADSCV team; Jean-Vincent Le Bé, Jasmine Petry, Yvan Bouza, James Clulow and Akos Spiegel from the Nestlé STC team; Frank Paris from DOQS; Théophile Emmanouilidis and Sélim Ach from Thoth. This book has been written using the R package {Bookdown} from Xie (2016) further customized with a layout developped by Matthew J. C. Crump. Plot themes have been adapted from the package {cowplot} by Claus O.Wilke.
